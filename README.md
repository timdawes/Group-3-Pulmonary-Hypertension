# Group-3-Pulmonary-Hypertension
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in chronic lung disease is common, linked to poor prognosis and has no long-term data to understand treatment strategies. We present longitudinal cohort (n=184) of incident group 3 PH patients with over 380 patient.years follow up to understand the associations of treatment with survival. All code used in the analysis is given below.

## Software and hardware requirements
All statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; www.r-project.org) using RStudio version 1.3.1073 (Boston, Mass). Analysis was completed on a 2017 iMac with 4.2 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 and 64Gb RAM.
